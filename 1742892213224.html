<li><strong>Link to Favicon:</strong> The link to the favicon is present, but ensure it resolves correctly and appears across all pages.</li>

<li><strong>Internal Linking:</strong> Add internal links to other relevant pages on the site to improve navigation and distribute link equity throughout your site.</li>
