<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Issues – Must be fixed immediately:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing meta keywords tag</strong>: The <code>&lt;meta name="keywords" keywords=""&gt;</code> is empty. Remove it if not needed or fill it with relevant keywords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duplicate viewport meta tag</strong>: There are two <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"&gt;</code> tags. Retain only one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing 'alt' attributes on images</strong>: Some images lack 'alt' text (e.g., logos in the marquee). All images should have descriptive 'alt' attributes for accessibility and SEO.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Canonical URL issues</strong>: Ensure the <code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://n8n.io"&gt;</code> points to the correct page to avoid duplicate content issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quick Wins – Easy fixes with a big impact:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add title tags to images and icons</strong>: Provide title attributes to key images for better context and SEO.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimize images for SEO</strong>: Ensure that all images are compressed and optimized for faster loading. Consider changing the image formats to WebP where applicable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use structured data</strong>: Ensure that structured data (JSON-LD) is implemented properly to enhance search visibility. The existing script should be validated for completeness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improve internal linking</strong>: Include more internal links within the content to enhance site navigation and SEO.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opportunities for Improvement – Require more effort but offer potential benefits:</strong></p></li>

<h3 id="contentqualityassessment">Content Quality Assessment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Quality</strong>: The content of the webpage provides a clear and engaging overview of the n8n workflow automation tool, emphasizing its features and benefits for technical users. The language is concise, but there are sections that could benefit from deeper explanations or examples to illustrate complex features.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Technical claims about the product's capabilities, such as saving time and the ability to automate tasks, appear to be well-founded. However, without detailed use cases or testimonials, these claims carry less weight.</li>
