<p><strong>Critical Issues – Must be fixed immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing Alt Attributes for Images:</strong> The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag for the logo lacks an <code>alt</code> attribute, which is essential for accessibility and SEO.</li>
<li><strong>No H2 Tags:</strong> Multiple sections lack proper heading structure, with only an H1 and no H2s, which may hinder accessibility and content hierarchy issues.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Add Missing Alt Attributes:</strong> Include <code>alt</code> text for the logo and any other images to improve accessibility and SEO.</li>

<li><strong>Use Canonical Link Element:</strong> Add a canonical link element to prevent potential duplicate content issues.</li>
